Module â€“ Installation and configuration of Ansible
==================================================

The first step in using Ansible with an F5 product is to ensure that you
have done the absolute minimum required to make Ansible work.

The recipes in this chapter look at methods for installing and configuring
Ansible. We cover things such as installing the tool, establishing the
correct directory layouts, and creating necessary files.

We will focus on using Ansible 2.5 for this class. This specific version
of Ansible, at the time of this writing, is not officially released. This
will not be a problem for us, and will also serve to prepare you for what
is coming in the future.

Creating a virtual server on BIG-IP
===================================

Problem
-------

You need to create a virtual server, associated with a pool, on a BIG-IP

Solution
--------

Use the ``bigip_virtual_server`` module.

#. Create a ``lab2.5`` directory in the ``labs`` directory.
#. Setup the filesystem layout to mirror the one :doc:`described in lab 1.3</class1/module1/lab03>`.
#. Add a ``bigip`` host to the ansible inventory and give it an ``ansible_host``
   fact with the value ``10.1.1.4``
#. *Type* the following into the ``playbooks/site.yaml`` file.

   - name: An example virtual server playbook
     hosts: bigip
     connection: local

     vars:
       validate_certs: no
       username: admin
       password: admin

     tasks:
       - name: Create web server VIP
         bigip_virtual_server:
           description: webserver-vip
           destination: 10.1.1.100
           password: "{{ password }}"
           name: vip-1
           pool: web-servers
           port: 80
           server: 10.1.1.4
           snat: Automap
           user: "{{ username }}"
           profiles:
             - http
             - clientssl
           validate_certs: "{{ validate_certs }}"

Run this playbook, from the ``lab2.5`` directory like so

  ::

   $ ansible-playbook -i inventory/hosts playbooks/site.yaml

Discussion
----------

The ``bigip_virtual_server`` module can configure a number of attributes for a
virtual server. At a minimum, the ``name`` is required.

This module is idempotent. Therefore, you can run it over and over again
and so-long as no settings have been changed, this module will report no
changes.

Several arguments, such as ``policies`` and ``profiles`` take a list of values.
If you update this list of values, it will be reflected on the virtual
serverâ€™s configuration. This includes removing items from these lists.

As an example, if you have four items in the ``profile`` list, and then you
remove one, this will cause the virtual server to be reconfigured to only
have three profiles.

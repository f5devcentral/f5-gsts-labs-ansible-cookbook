Module â€“ Slightly more advanced Ansible usage
=============================================

Basic administration should serve you well for quite some time.

As you become more seasoned in using the tool and understanding the
way that both Ansible and your BIG-IP behave, you will want to begin
to brave the world of more advanced playbook and deployment scenarios.

The recipes in this chapter look at even more modules, some of which
you may use less often than others.

Throughout the course of this chapter we will also explore topics in
Ansible that are a step beyond basic. These include prompts, encrypted
files, and interrupting the flows of the a play through the use of
custom arguments.

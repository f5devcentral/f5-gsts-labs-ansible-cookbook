Filing bugs
===========

Problem
-------

You need to report a bug in an F5 Ansible module

Solution
--------

Create an issue on our `Github issue tracker here`_

When creating issues, you will be asked to fill out a number of fields.

* Issue type
* Component name
* Ansible version
* BIGIP version
* Library versions
* Configuration
* OS/Environment
* Summary
* Steps to reproduce
* Expected results
* Actual results

It is **critical** that you provide as much information as possible if you hope to
get your bug fixed.

Discussion
----------

All customers, F5’ers, partners, everyone…needs to file issues on Github. This is
a publicly operated project and we use the publicly available Github issue tracker
to manage it.

**It is not acceptable** to directly email Tim with a bug you found. He will direct
you to the Issue tracker.

Why is it so important that you log bugs in the issue tracker? Because of the way
that we manage fixes in our source tree. Every issue has a dedicated test file that
is created for it. Therefore, if you do not create an issue, we cannot create a file
in our source tree to test a fix.

I repeat, because I cannot stress this enough,

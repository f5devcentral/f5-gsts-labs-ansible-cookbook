Getting assistance with a problem
=================================

Problem
-------

You need to ask for help in using an F5 Ansible module or debugging a problem in a module

Solution
--------

Use either of the following channels

* `f5CloudSolutions Slack team`_ in the *#ansible* channel
* Join, and send email to, ***sme_ansible**

Both channels are monitored with roughly equal consistency. However, if you do not receive a timely response on one channel, consider asking on another channel

Discussion
----------

You have the option of getting real-time interactive help (via Slack), or,
semi-realtime help (via email).

The maintainers of the F5 Ansible modules are located in Seattle at the time
of this writing. Therefore, it is not always realistic to expect to get a
response immediately in our Slack channel.

On both communication channels, there is a growing body of tribal knowledge
being accumulated among the channel participants. We are beginning to see
several non-F5 participants helping answer questions about our modules.

We fully encourage this to continue.
